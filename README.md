# Structure Modelling and Comparison of SIK Isoforms (Research Internship)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my **research internship project** on structure modelling and active site comparison of Salt-Inducible Kinases (SIKs).  
The focus was on **SIK1B isoform** using homology modelling and molecular docking techniques.  

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Swiss Model, Modeller (Homology modelling)  
- PyMOL, UCSF Chimera (Visualization)  
- CASTp (Active site prediction)  
- AutoDock Vina, Discovery Studio (Docking)  

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `report/` → Internship report (IEEE format).  
- `presentation/` → Internship presentation slides.   

## 🎯 Applications
- Understanding structural differences in SIK isoforms.  
- Identifying druggable active sites for cancer and metabolic disease research.
